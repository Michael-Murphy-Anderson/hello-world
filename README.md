# hello-world

Hi! I'm Michael Murphy Anderson. I graduated from The Ohio State University in 2014 with a degree in Microbiology, and ever since, I have been working as a research lab technician at Columbia University in NYC. I am no longer satisfied with my position, and honestly, going for more education in this field REALLY does not interest me. Luckily, I'm  getting laid off! It is time to make a life change at the ripe young age of 24.
